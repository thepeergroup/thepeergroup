<h2>As a <span class="em">video producer</span>,</h2>

<p>
  Matt will work with you to develop online video-based programs that replace the in-person programs your organization used to rely on for income.
</p>

<p>
  For a smaller budget than you'd need with a video production studio, Matt will guide you through all the stages of program development, including ideation, planning, filming, editing, and marketing.
</p>

<p>
  Matt's most recent work involved creating an <a href="https://www.mettaearth.org/programs/herbal-skills-immersion/" target="_blank">online program</a> for a retreat center that cannot presently offer in-person retreats. The program, a 3-hour course in making plant-based skin care remedies, evoked the presenters' genuine personalities and the knowledge they wanted to share, as well as a sense of place.
