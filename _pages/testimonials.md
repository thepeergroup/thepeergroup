## Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Matt!

I'm a 31-year-old mediator and software developer looking for short(ish)-term housing in Massachusetts.

I'm looking to live in or near a quiet single-family home—such as in an above-garage apartment, attic apartment, guesthouse, or other type of accessory dwelling unit.

My only other needs are access to a kitchen and reliable Wifi. (I've lived in places with wood stoves, so even regular heat is optional for me.)

(I would just rent an apartment, but the loud stomping noises that come with apartment living don't quite work for me. My best arrangement would be one with nobody above me and nobody sharing a wall.)

A few things about me:

- I care a lot about healthy communication, peace-building, and democracy. (If you're voting for a fascist would-be autocrat this November, please do not get in touch! Thanks!)
- I'm very friendly and I love community, but I also benefit from good doses of quiet introspective time.
- I'm also generally substance-free: I don't smoke anything, and I don't really drink, though I'd hang out while sipping a Scotch if you insisted.
- I recently started identifying as trans/non-binary. To explain further, I do not fit society's ideas of my assigned gender (male/masculine), and I feel most comfortable socializing with women, femmes, and queer folk. I use they/them or he/him pronouns.

I'm happy to consider a wide variety of arrangements, such as a standard rent-paying arrangement, or one in which I can offset rent by providing services like cooking, housesitting, petsitting, gardening, snow clearing, in-home care, and even raising chickens (if the zoning allows). I'm open to your ideas!

I'm most interested in shorter-term arrangements (1–3 months with an opportunity for extension), and I'd be happy to either use a standard lease agreement or write up an informal but enforceable-in-small-claims-court agreement so we have something in writing that works for both of us.

I am very safe and aware regarding COVID, and eager to follow science-based protocols to create a closed bubble in which everyone can feel safe.

Lastly, while I am presently underemployed, I am so by conscious choice, and I have the resources to pay rent for the foreseeable future without any issues.

Feel free to look around [my website](/) some more if you'd like to learn about the kind of work I do.
