# About The Peer Group

<br />

### The problem we're working to solve:

Small companies, startups, and non-profits often don't have the resources or experience to hire conflict management or HR professionals the way large companies do, but these types of organizations still have conflicts that would benefit from analysis and management. Conflict, when managed well, can result in learning and growth; when managed well, it can result in unnecessary firings, resignations, and other types of workplace churn and blockages. Unidentified or poorly-managed conflict prevents the organization from doing the work it wants to do.

### Our hypothesis:

By providing conflict management and consulting services, at a scale and price point right for small companies, startups, and non-profits, we can help these teams move through conflict and get back to the work of their core mission.

## Our Approach

> "[W]e should nonetheless take a clear stand against oppression and injustice. We should strive to change the situation, without taking sides in a conflict. We are committed to learning to look with the eyes of interbeing and to see ourselves and others as cells in one [community]." ~ Order of Interbeing, Protecting and Nourishing the Sangha

Our approach to conflict is based on nonviolent communication, mindfulness, and trauma theory.

We help resolve conflicts withotu making anybody "wrong". We aim to transform the conflictual situation into productive growth for your business or organization, and for the individuals in it.

## Who we work with

> "We are committed not to live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and nature. We will do our best to select a livelihood that contributes to the wellbeing of all species on earth and helps realize our ideal of understanding and compassion." - Order of Interbeing, Right Livelihood

While its practitioners stay neutral (or "omnipartial") in managing a conflict, The Peer Group is not neutral in its values.

We're eager to work with organizations who contribute to health, happiness, peace, or freedom through means that can be described as non-harming, truthful, and generous.
