# Joining the Peer Group

We are building a team of skillful, mindful peace-builders and consultants.

## What we're doing

As an early bootstrapped (self-funded) startup, we're hiring partners as independent contractors until we build enough business to start offering steady salaries.

We believe that health care is a human right, so we intend to, once we accumulate enough business, offer good, staedy salaries with excellent healthcare.

As implied by the name, every member of our team will be treated as a peer, no matter when you joined or what your role is in the organization's structure. You deserve respect, consideration, to be listened to, and to feel like you belong on this team.

Working at The Peer Group, you can expected to be treated like a full human with needs and values.

"Professional" doesn’t mean being a neutral shell of yourself, but rather bringing your full self to your work. You’ll be expected and encouraged to show up.

Our leadership "dogfoods" conflict resolution and organizational dynamics, meaning that the services we provide and strategies we recommend to others, we also do for ourselves.

We value self-care beyond the headline value. Yes, do a reflective practice and take care of your skin and stay hydrated. But also set appropriate boundaries between yourself and the work you do. There’s a blurry area between caring enough and caring so much you get sucked in and take full responsibility for the work.

### The values behind the name

We chose the name “The Peer Group” for a number of reasons.

First, our purpose is to look deeply, or “peer” into the situations we’re called into. Our job is to develop insight, convey that insight in ways our clients can receive it and act on it, and help nurture the capacity of our clients to develop clear sight. Our organization’s purpose is to help other organizations develop clear sight.

Second, the name is a reminder that our clients are our peers. They are not bound to us, we are not subservient to them—we’ve come together for a mutually productive relationship with a dedication to service paired with healthy boundaries. We care about the work, but we don’t remain in abusive working relationships because we need to pay the bills.

Third, the name is a reminder that everyone who works at The Peer Group peers—we treat each other as equals. We hold this reality while also holding the reality that some of us might have different amounts of experience or different roles in the organizational structure. This isn’t to imply a totally flat, anarchic structure, but to remember that we are all fundamentally equals, and deserving of respect. Thich Nhat Hanh might suggest we all treat each other with the same care we would treat a guest.

Fourth, we don’t have competitors—we have peers. Our clients may compare us to other firms, as they should when determine who to provide services. However, we will not buy into the capitalist narrative that encourages us to treat other firms as “competitors” or “competition” or adversaries, and will stand firm in treating them as equals and collaborators. Additionally, we understand the philosophy behind capitalism that says that adversarial or competitive relationships can lead to evolution. Inspired by many, many other examples from nature, however, we choose a collaborative, peaceful approach to evolution.

Lastly, the technology we use is inspired by Palantir, but with a different purpose in mind. In Lord of the Rings, a palantir (pl. palantiri) is an orb through which Sauron (the overarching evil villain) and his closest collaborators can communicate. Palantir, the company, uses data and technology ICE and local police departments in practices that range from problematic to dystopian to unconstitutional. Peer, the software that The Peer Group uses to do conflict mapping & analysis, is available to non-profits and pro-democracy organizations to do social analysis, power mapping, etc. Essentially, we are trying to democratize (expand access to) the type of social mapping technology that Palantir uses so that technology can be used for good. We have some controls and review systems to ensure that Peer does not fall into the wrong hands and is not used for the purposes we do not approve of.


## Who we're looking for

Are you a consultant, conflict resolver, or peace-builder looking to join our team?

You'll likely be a great fit if you:

- can demonstrate a high level of skill in nonviolent communication (sometimes called compassionate communication)
- can demonstrate an ability to see the whole conflict or situation, not just one or two perspectives
- have some sort of mindfulness practice, regardless of particular tradition
- show support for equality and equity, including but not limited to supporting the Movement for Black Lives, LGBTQ+ rights, and basic human rights
